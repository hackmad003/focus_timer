## Understanding the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into focused intervals separated by short breaks.

### The Classic Cycle

1. **Focus Session (25 min)** - Work on a single task
2. **Short Break (5 min)** - Rest and recharge
3. **Repeat** - Complete 4 focus sessions
4. **Long Break (10 min)** - Take a longer break after 4 sessions
5. **Restart** - Begin a new cycle

### Why It Works

- **Focused Work** - Single-tasking improves concentration
- **Regular Breaks** - Prevents burnout and maintains energy
- **Time Awareness** - Makes time tangible and manageable
- **Reduced Procrastination** - 25 minutes feels achievable
- **Improved Estimation** - Track how long tasks actually take
